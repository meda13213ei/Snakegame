# The Snake game is designed based of the original snake game rules using Turtle module from Python.

# In the game of Snake, the player uses the arrow keys to move a "snake" around the board. As the snake finds food,
# it eats the food, and thereby grows larger. The game ends when the snake either moves off the screen or moves into itself.
# The goal is to make the snake as large as possible before that happens.


# Run the following code in pycharm or any python based IDE.
# Use the arrows to direct the snake in the preffered direction.
# Everytime snake consumes a food another food appears at a random Location on the board.
# It increases its length accordingly as well.
# 
# The Visible area is only the playable area. if the snake hits any of the four edges. the Ga Enjoyme will be over.
# The Snake cannot turn 180 degrees which means it cannot turn down when its going up. or cannot turn right while going left and vice versa
# The Score is continously displayed on top of the Screen. 
# There is no Timer to complete the game.
# Take as long as you like to Play it.

# Enjoy The Game. Please give your feedback on how you felt about the game in this website.
